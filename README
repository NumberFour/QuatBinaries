repo for storing QA binaries

when updating binary to new version, use update scritp in repo

procedure:
1) copy new binary file to /bin/ folder
2) in terminal run update script old and new file names as parameters (filename must include extension)
update oldFielName newFileName

eg:
update selenium-server-standalone-2.16.0.jar selenium-server-standalone-2.170.jar


rest is done by the script:
 - adding new file to repo
 - writing proper commit
 - removing old file from repo, history, etc (history, branches, tags are rewritten both locally and on github)
 - reclaiming space
 - push to github
